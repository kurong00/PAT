# Head of a Gang （30 分)

One way that the police finds the head of a gang is to check people's phone calls. If there is a phone call between AAA and BBB, we say that AAA and BBB is related. The weight of a relation is defined to be the total time length of all the phone calls made between the two persons. A "Gang" is a cluster of more than 2 persons who are related to each other with total relation weight being greater than a given threthold KKK. In each gang, the one with maximum total weight is the head. Now given a list of phone calls, you are supposed to find the gangs and the heads.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two positive numbers NNN and KKK (both less than or equal to 1000), the number of phone calls and the weight threthold, respectively. Then NNN lines follow, each in the following format:

    Name1 Name2 Time
    

where `Name1` and `Name2` are the names of people at the two ends of the call, and `Time` is the length of the call. A name is a string of three capital letters chosen from `A`-`Z`. A time length is a positive integer which is no more than 1000 minutes.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print in a line the total number of gangs. Then for each gang, print in a line the name of the head and the total number of the members. It is guaranteed that the head is unique for each gang. The output must be sorted according to the alphabetical order of the names of the heads.

### Sample Input 1:

    8 59
    AAA BBB 10
    BBB AAA 20
    AAA CCC 40
    DDD EEE 5
    EEE DDD 70
    FFF GGG 30
    GGG HHH 20
    HHH FFF 10
    

### Sample Output 1:

    2
    AAA 3
    GGG 3
    

### Sample Input 2:

    8 70
    AAA BBB 10
    BBB AAA 20
    AAA CCC 40
    DDD EEE 5
    EEE DDD 70
    FFF GGG 30
    GGG HHH 20
    HHH FFF 10
    

### Sample Output 2:

    0

### 题目解析

 - 可以利用map来一一对应名字和时间，根据题意建立一个无向图，然后DFS。
 - 注意DFS时要先将访问的点进行标记已经访问过，防止死循环：
 `visit[name] = 1;`
 - 当出现权重更大的name时替换当前gang的领头名字

   `if (weight[name] > weight[headOfGang])   headOfGang = name;`
 - 判断是否满足条件，因为无向图我们在遍历的时候将time都加了两遍，所以和 `k*2` 比较

    `if (gangMember > 2 && totalTime > k * 2)
			ans[headOfGang] = gangMember;`

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
#include<map>
using namespace std;
map<string, vector<string>> graph;
map<string, int> visit,weight,ans;
int gangMember, totalTime;
string headOfGang;
void DFS(string name) {
	visit[name] = 1;
	gangMember++;
	totalTime += weight[name];
	if (weight[name] > weight[headOfGang])
		headOfGang = name;
	for (auto it = graph[name].begin(); it != graph[name].end(); it++)
		if (visit[*it]==0)
			DFS(*it);
}
int main() {
	int n, k, time; cin >> n >> k;
	string name1, name2;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> name1 >> name2 >> time;
		graph[name1].push_back(name2);
		graph[name2].push_back(name1);
		weight[name1] += time;
		weight[name2] += time;
	}
	for (auto it = graph.begin(); it != graph.end(); it++) {
		if (visit[it->first] == 0){
			gangMember = 0, totalTime = 0;
			headOfGang = it->first;
			DFS(headOfGang);
		}
		if (gangMember > 2 && totalTime > k * 2)
			ans[headOfGang] = gangMember;
	}
	cout << ans.size() << endl;
	for (auto it = ans.begin(); it != ans.end(); it++)
		cout << it->first << " " << it->second << endl;
	return 0;
}
