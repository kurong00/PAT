# 1115 Counting Nodes in a BST （30 分)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Insert a sequence of numbers into an initially empty binary search tree. Then you are supposed to count the total number of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer NNN (≤1000\\le 1000≤1000) which is the size of the input sequence. Then given in the next line are the NNN integers in \[−10001000\]\[-1000 1000\]\[−10001000\] which are supposed to be inserted into an initially empty binary search tree.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in one line the numbers of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree in the format:

    n1 + n2 = n
    

where `n1` is the number of nodes in the lowest level, `n2` is that of the level above, and `n` is the sum.

### Sample Input:

    9
    25 30 42 16 20 20 35 -5 28
    

### Sample Output:

    2 + 4 = 6

### 题目解析

注意插入节点的时候 else if (data <= current->data) <= 都加入左子树

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int maxDepth = -1;
struct node
{
	int data;
	node* left, * right;
};
node* InSert(node* current, int data) {
	if (current == NULL) {
		current = new node();
		current->data = data;
		current->left = current->right = NULL;
	}
	else if (data <= current->data)
		current->left = InSert(current->left, data);
	else
		current->right = InSert(current->right, data);
	return current;
}
void DFS(node* current, vector<int>& nodeDepth, int depth) {
	if (current == NULL) {
		maxDepth = (maxDepth < depth) ? depth : maxDepth;
		return;
	}
	nodeDepth[depth]++;
	DFS(current->left, nodeDepth, depth + 1);
	DFS(current->right, nodeDepth, depth + 1);
}
int main()
{
	int n; cin >> n;
	node* head = NULL;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int temp; cin >> temp;
		head = InSert(head, temp);
	}
	vector<int> depth(n, 0);
	DFS(head, depth, 0);
	cout << depth[maxDepth - 1] << " + " << depth[maxDepth - 2] << " = " << depth[maxDepth - 1] + depth[maxDepth - 2];
	return 0;
}
```
