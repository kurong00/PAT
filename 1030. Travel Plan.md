# 1030 Travel Plan

## 题目描述

> A traveler's map gives the distances between cities along the highways, together with the cost of each highway. Now you are supposed to write a program to help a traveler to decide the shortest path between his/her starting city and the destination. If such a shortest path is not unique, you are supposed to output the one with the minimum cost, which is guaranteed to be unique.

## 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, each gives the information of a sequence. For each sequence, the first positive integer N (<=1000000) is the size of that sequence. Then N integers follow, separated by a space. It is guaranteed that all the integers are in the range of **long int**.

## 输出描述

> For each test case you should output the median of the two given sequences in a line.
