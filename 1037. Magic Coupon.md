# 1037 Magic Coupon (25 分)

The magic shop in Mars is offering some magic coupons. Each coupon has an integer NNN printed on it, meaning that when you use this coupon with a product, you may get NNN times the value of that product back! What is more, the shop also offers some bonus product for free. However, if you apply a coupon with a positive NNN to this bonus product, you will have to pay the shop NNN times the value of the bonus product... but hey, magically, they have some coupons with negative NNN's!

For example, given a set of coupons { 1 2 4 −1-1−1 }, and a set of product values { 7 6 −2-2−2 −3-3−3 } (in Mars dollars M$) where a negative value corresponds to a bonus product. You can apply coupon 3 (with NNN being 4) to product 1 (with value M$7) to get M$28 back; coupon 2 to product 2 to get M$12 back; and coupon 4 to product 4 to get M$3 back. On the other hand, if you apply coupon 3 to product 4, you will have to pay M$12 to the shop.

Each coupon and each product may be selected at most once. Your task is to get as much money back as possible.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains the number of coupons NCN_CN​C​​, followed by a line with NCN_CN​C​​ coupon integers. Then the next line contains the number of products NPN_PN​P​​, followed by a line with NPN_PN​P​​ product values. Here 1≤NC,NP≤1051\\le N\_C, N\_P \\le 10^51≤N​C​​,N​P​​≤10​5​​, and it is guaranteed that all the numbers will not exceed 2302^{30}2​30​​.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, simply print in a line the maximum amount of money you can get back.

### Sample Input:

    4
    1 2 4 -1
    4
    7 6 -2 -3
    

### Sample Output:

    43
