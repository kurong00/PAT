# 1047 Student List for Course (25 分)

Zhejiang University has 40,000 students and provides 2,500 courses. Now given the registered course list of each student, you are supposed to output the student name lists of all the courses.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 numbers: NNN (≤40,000\\le 40,000≤40,000), the total number of students, and KKK (≤2,500\\le 2,500≤2,500), the total number of courses. Then NNN lines follow, each contains a student's name (3 capital English letters plus a one-digit number), a positive number CCC (≤20\\le 20≤20) which is the number of courses that this student has registered, and then followed by CCC course numbers. For the sake of simplicity, the courses are numbered from 1 to KKK.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the student name lists of all the courses in increasing order of the course numbers. For each course, first print in one line the course number and the number of registered students, separated by a space. Then output the students' names in alphabetical order. Each name occupies a line.

### Sample Input:

    10 5
    ZOE1 2 4 5
    ANN0 3 5 2 1

### 题目解析

用scanf代替cin，prinf代替cout即可

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>  
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
	vector<vector<string>> course(k+1);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		char str[10];scanf("%s",&str);
		string name = str;
		int count, temp; cin >> count;
		for (int j = 0; j < count; j++) {
			cin >> temp;
			course[temp].push_back(name);
		}
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
		sort(course[i].begin(), course[i].end());
		cout << i << " " << course[i].size() << endl;
		for (int j = 0; j < course[i].size(); j++) {
			string s = course[i][j];
			char str[10];
			strcpy(str, s.c_str());
			printf("%s\n", str);
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```
