### 题目描述

> When shipping goods with containers, we have to be careful not to pack some incompatible goods into the same container, or we might get ourselves in serious trouble. For example, oxidizing agent （氧化剂） must not be packed with flammable liquid （易燃液体）, or it can cause explosion.
>
>Now you are given a long list of incompatible goods, and several lists of goods to be shipped. You are supposed to tell if all the goods in a list can be packed into the same container.


### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: N (≤10^4), the number of pairs of incompatible goods, and M (≤100), the number of lists of goods to be shipped.
>
>Then two blocks follow. The first block contains N pairs of incompatible goods, each pair occupies a line; and the second one contains M lists of goods to be shipped, each list occupies a line in the following format:
>
>- K G[1] G[2] ... G[K]
>
>where K (≤1,000) is the number of goods and G[i]'s are the IDs of the goods. To make it simple, each good is represented by a 5-digit ID number. All the numbers in a line are separated by spaces.

### 输出描述:
> For each shipping list, print in a line Yes if there are no incompatible goods in the list, or No if not.

## 题目解析

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int N = 100005;
vector<vector<int>> goods(N);
void Check() {
	int n; cin >> n;
	vector<int> query(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		cin >> query[i];
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < i;j++) {
			for(int k=0;k<goods[query[i]].size();k++)
				if (goods[query[i]][k] == query[j]) {
					cout << "No" << endl;
					return;
				}
		}
	}
	cout << "Yes" << endl;
}
int main() {
	int n, m,good1,good2; cin >> n >> m;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> good1 >> good2;
		goods[good1].push_back(good2);
		goods[good2].push_back(good1);
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
		Check();
	return 0;
}
