# 1013 Battle Over Cities (25 分)

It is vitally important to have all the cities connected by highways in a war. If a city is occupied by the enemy, all the highways from/toward that city are closed. We must know immediately if we need to repair any other highways to keep the rest of the cities connected. Given the map of cities which have all the remaining highways marked, you are supposed to tell the number of highways need to be repaired, quickly.

For example, if we have 3 cities and 2 highways connecting city1city_1city​1​​-city2city_2city​2​​ and city1city_1city​1​​-city3city_3city​3​​. Then if city1city_1city​1​​ is occupied by the enemy, we must have 1 highway repaired, that is the highway city2city_2city​2​​-city3city_3city​3​​.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 3 numbers NNN (<1000<1000<1000), MMM and KKK, which are the total number of cities, the number of remaining highways, and the number of cities to be checked, respectively. Then MMM lines follow, each describes a highway by 2 integers, which are the numbers of the cities the highway connects. The cities are numbered from 1 to NNN. Finally there is a line containing KKK numbers, which represent the cities we concern.

### Output Specification:

For each of the KKK cities, output in a line the number of highways need to be repaired if that city is lost.

### Sample Input:

    3 2 3
    1 2
    1 3
    1 2 3
    

### Sample Output:

    1
    0
    0

### 题目解析

题目的要求就是查询每个节点在去除这个节点下的连通分量-1，DFS即可解决，注意去除这个节点就是在DFS之前把visit[要去除的节点] = 1

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int city[1005][1005], visit[1005];
int n, m, k;
void DFS(int root) {
	visit[root] = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
		if (!visit[i] && city[root][i])
			DFS(i);
}
int main() {
	cin >> n >> m >> k;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int a, b; cin >> a >> b;
		city[a][b] = 1;
		city[b][a] = 1;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
		int cityID, count = 0; cin >> cityID;
		fill(visit, visit + 1005, 0);
		visit[cityID] = 1;
		for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
			if (!visit[j]) {
				DFS(j);
				count++;
			}
		printf("%d\n", count - 1);
	}
	return 0;
}
```
