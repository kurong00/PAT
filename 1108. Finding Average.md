### 题目描述

> The basic task is simple: given N real numbers, you are supposed to calculate their average. But what makes it complicated is that some of the input numbers might not be legal. A "legal" input is a real number in [-1000, 1000] and is accurate up to no more than 2 decimal places. When you calculate the average, those illegal numbers must not be counted in.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=100). Then N numbers are given in the next line, separated by one space.

### 输出描述:
> For each illegal input number, print in a line "ERROR: X is not a legal number" where X is the input. Then finally print in a line the result: "The average of K numbers is Y" where K is the number of legal inputs and Y is their average, accurate to 2 decimal places. In case the average cannot be calculated, output "Undefined" instead of Y. In case K is only 1, output "The average of 1 number is Y" instead.

### 输入例子
> 7
>
>5 -3.2 aaa 9999 2.3.4 7.123 2.35

### 输出例子
> ERROR: aaa is not a legal number
>
>ERROR: 9999 is not a legal number
>
>ERROR: 2.3.4 is not a legal number
>
>ERROR: 7.123 is not a legal number
>
>The average of 3 numbers is 1.38



## 题目解析
注意当合法数字只有一个的时候输出的：
```C++
		cout << "The average of 1 number is " << fixed << setprecision(2) << sum / count << endl;
```
number为单数

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
#include<string>
#include<strstream>
using namespace std;
bool IsLegal(string number) {
	if (number.length() > 7)
		return false;
	if (!isdigit(number[0]) && number[0] != '-')
		return false;
	for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++)
		if (number[i] == '.'&&number.length() - i - 1 > 2)
			return false;
	if (stof(number) > 1000 || stof(number) < -1000)
		return false;
	return true;
}
int main() {
	int n; cin >> n;
	string s;
	int count = 0;
	float sum = 0.0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> s;
		if (IsLegal(s)) {
			sum += stof(s);
			count++;
		}
		else
			cout << "ERROR: " << s << " is not a legal number" << endl;
	}
	if (count == 0)
		cout << "The average of 0 numbers is Undefined" << endl;
	else if (count == 1)
		cout << "The average of 1 number is " << fixed << setprecision(2) << sum / count << endl;
	else
		cout << "The average of " << count << " numbers is " << fixed << setprecision(2) << sum / count << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
