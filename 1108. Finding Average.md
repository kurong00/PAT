# 1108 Finding Average （20 分)

The basic task is simple: given NNN real numbers, you are supposed to calculate their average. But what makes it complicated is that some of the input numbers might not be legal. A **legal** input is a real number in \[−1000,1000-1000, 1000−1000,1000\] and is accurate up to no more than 2 decimal places. When you calculate the average, those illegal numbers must not be counted in.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer NNN (≤100\\le 100≤100). Then NNN numbers are given in the next line, separated by one space.

### Output Specification:

For each illegal input number, print in a line `ERROR: X is not a legal number` where `X` is the input. Then finally print in a line the result: `The average of K numbers is Y` where `K` is the number of legal inputs and `Y` is their average, accurate to 2 decimal places. In case the average cannot be calculated, output `Undefined` instead of `Y`. In case `K` is only 1, output `The average of 1 number is Y` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

    7
    5 -3.2 aaa 9999 2.3.4 7.123 2.35
    

### Sample Output 1:

    ERROR: aaa is not a legal number
    ERROR: 9999 is not a legal number
    ERROR: 2.3.4 is not a legal number
    ERROR: 7.123 is not a legal number
    The average of 3 numbers is 1.38
    

### Sample Input 2:

    2
    aaa -9999
    

### Sample Output 2:

    ERROR: aaa is not a legal number
    ERROR: -9999 is not a legal number
    The average of 0 numbers is Undefined

### 题目解析

注意当合法数字只有一个的时候输出的：`printf("The average of 1 number is %.2f", sum / count);` **number** 为单数

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
bool IsLegal(string str) {
	if (str.length() > 7)return false;
	if (!isdigit(str[0]) && str[0] != '-') return false;
	for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++)
		if (str[i] == '.' && str.length() - i - 1 > 2) return false;
	if (stof(str) > 1000 || stof(str) < -1000)return false;
	return true;
}
int main() {
	int n,count=0; cin >> n;
	float sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		string str; cin >> str;
		if (IsLegal(str)) { 
			sum += stof(str); 
			count++;
		}
		else cout << "ERROR: " << str << " is not a legal number" << endl;
	}
	if (count == 0) printf("The average of 0 numbers is Undefined");
	else if (count == 1) printf("The average of 1 number is %.2f", sum / count);
	else printf("The average of %d numbers is %.2f", count, sum / count);
	return 0;
}
```
