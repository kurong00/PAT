# 1029 Median （25 分)

Given an increasing sequence S of N integers, the median is the number at the middle position. For example, the median of S1 = { 11, 12, 13, 14 } is 12, and the median of S2 = { 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 } is 15. The median of two sequences is defined to be the median of the nondecreasing sequence which contains all the elements of both sequences. For example, the median of S1 and S2 is 13.

Given two increasing sequences of integers, you are asked to find their median.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, each gives the information of a sequence. For each sequence, the first positive integer N (≤2×105\\le 2\\times 10^5≤2×10​5​​) is the size of that sequence. Then N integers follow, separated by a space. It is guaranteed that all the integers are in the range of **long int**.

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the median of the two given sequences in a line.

### Sample Input:

    4 11 12 13 14
    5 9 10 15 16 17
    

### Sample Output:

    13

### 题目解析

- 两个输入的数组是有序数组，如果只是将数据都复制到一个大数组中，再进行排序，浪费空间，时间复杂度也太高，因此问题主要在**合并两个有序数组**上。
- 因为内存有限，因此只保存一个序列，另一个序列边输入边检查

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n,s1[200005]; cin >> n;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
		scanf("%d", &s1[i]);
	s1[n + 1] = 1e7;
	int m; cin >> m;
	int midPos = (n + m + 1) / 2, i = 1,temp,count=0;
	for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
		scanf("%d", &temp);
		while (s1[i]<temp){
			count++;
			if (count == midPos) cout << s1[i];
			i++;
		}
		count++;
		if (count == midPos) cout << temp;
	}
	while (i<=n){
		count++;
		if (count == midPos) cout << s1[i];
		i++;
	}
	return 0;
}
