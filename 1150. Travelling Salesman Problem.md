# 1150 Travelling Salesman Problem （25 分)

The "travelling salesman problem" asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science. (Quoted from "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling\_salesman\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)".)

In this problem, you are supposed to find, from a given list of cycles, the one that is the closest to the solution of a travelling salesman problem.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers NNN (2<N≤2002< N \\le 2002<N≤200), the number of cities, and MMM, the number of edges in an undirected graph. Then MMM lines follow, each describes an edge in the format `City1 City2 Dist`, where the cities are numbered from 1 to NNN and the distance `Dist` is positive and is no more than 100. The next line gives a positive integer KKK which is the number of paths, followed by KKK lines of paths, each in the format:

nnn C1C_1C​1​​ C2C_2C​2​​ ... CnC_nC​n​​

where nnn is the number of cities in the list, and CiC_iC​i​​'s are the cities on a path.

### Output Specification:

For each path, print in a line `Path X: TotalDist (Description)` where `X` is the index (starting from 1) of that path, `TotalDist` its total distance (if this distance does not exist, output `NA` instead), and `Description` is one of the following:

*   `TS simple cycle` if it is a simple cycle that visits every city;
*   `TS cycle` if it is a cycle that visits every city, but not a simple cycle;
*   `Not a TS cycle` if it is NOT a cycle that visits every city.

Finally print in a line `Shortest Dist(X) = TotalDist` where `X` is the index of the cycle that is the closest to the solution of a travelling salesman problem, and `TotalDist` is its total distance. It is guaranteed that such a solution is unique.

### Sample Input:

    6 10
    6 2 1
    3 4 1
    1 5 1
    2 5 1
    3 1 8
    4 1 6
    1 6 1
    6 3 1
    1 2 1
    4 5 1
    7
    7 5 1 4 3 6 2 5
    7 6 1 3 4 5 2 6
    6 5 1 4 3 6 2
    9 6 2 1 6 3 4 5 2 6
    4 1 2 5 1
    7 6 1 2 5 4 3 1
    7 6 3 2 5 4 1 6
    

### Sample Output:

    Path 1: 11 (TS simple cycle)
    Path 2: 13 (TS simple cycle)
    Path 3: 10 (Not a TS cycle)
    Path 4: 8 (TS cycle)
    Path 5: 3 (Not a TS cycle)
    Path 6: 13 (Not a TS cycle)
    Path 7: NA (Not a TS cycle)
    Shortest Dist(4) = 8

### 题目解析

注意几个输出的判断：

* Not a TS cycle：头尾不等、没有把所有的城市都遍历、城市不连通
* TS cycle：头尾相等但有的城市遍历过1遍以上
* TS simple cycle：头尾相等且城市只遍历过1遍
* 输出第二三种情况中距离最短的一种

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1e7;
int main() {
	int n, m, minDis = INF, minIndex = 0;cin >> n >> m;
	string output[3] = { " (TS simple cycle)"," (TS cycle)"," (Not a TS cycle)" };
	vector<vector<int>> city(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, INF));
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int a, b, c; cin >> a >> b >> c;
		city[a][b] = c;
		city[b][a] = c;
	}
	int k; cin >> k;
	for (int u = 1; u <= k; u++)
	{
		int count; cin >> count;
		vector<int> path(count),visit(n + 1, 0);
		int index = 0, totalDis = 0, count2 = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < count; i++){
			cin >> path[i];
			visit[path[i]]++;
		}
		for (int i = 1; i < count; i++)
			totalDis += city[path[i]][path[i - 1]];
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			if (visit[i] == 0||path[count - 1] != path[0]|| totalDis > INF)
				index = 2;
			if (visit[i] > 1)
				count2++;
		}
		if (count2 > 1) index = 1;
		cout << "Path " << u << ": ";
		if (totalDis < INF) cout << totalDis;
		else cout << "NA";
		cout << output[index] << endl;
		if (index != 2 && totalDis < minDis){
			minDis = totalDis;
			minIndex = u;
		}
	}
	printf("Shortest Dist(%d) = %d", minIndex, minDis);
	return 0;
}
