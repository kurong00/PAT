### 题目描述

> If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, the float numbers 12300 and 12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as 0.123*10^5^ with simple chopping. Now given the number of significant digits on a machine and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in that machine.
### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers N, A and B, where N (<100) is the number of significant digits, and A and B are the two float numbers to be compared. Each float number is non-negative, no greater than 10^100^, and that its total digit number is less than 100.


### 输出描述:
> For each test case, print in a line "YES" if the two numbers are treated equal, and then the number in the standard form "0.d~1~...d~N~*10\^k" (d~1~>0 unless the number is 0); or "NO" if they are not treated equal, and then the two numbers in their standard form. All the terms must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of a line.

>Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.

### 输入例子
> 3 12300 12358.9

### 输出例子
>YES 0.123*10^5

## 题目解析

#### 方法一：
```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
string OutPut(string s, int n) {
	string str = "0.";
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		str += s[i];
	str += ("*10^" + to_string(s.length()));
	return str;
}
int main()
{
	int n, flag = 1; string a, b;
	cin >> n >> a >> b;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		if (a[i] != b[i]) {
			flag = 0;
			break;
		}
	if (!flag)
		cout << "NO " << OutPut(a, n) << " " << OutPut(b, n);
	else
		cout << "YES " << (a.length() > b.length() ? OutPut(b, n) : OutPut(a, n));
	return 0;
}
```
