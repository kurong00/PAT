### 题目描述

> The string APPAPT contains two PAT's as substrings. The first one is formed by the 2nd, the 4th, and the 6th characters, and the second one is formed by the 3rd, the 4th, and the 6th characters.
>
>Now given any string, you are supposed to tell the number of PAT's contained in the string.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is only one line giving a string of no more than 10^5^ characters containing only P, A, or T.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, print in one line the number of PAT's contained in the string. Since the result may be a huge number, you only have to output the result moded by 1000000007.

### 输入例子
>APPAPT

### 输出例子
>2

## 题目解析
时间限制: 120ms，显然不可以用暴力突破。观察一下规律，对于每一个A，查找左边的P，查找右边的T，countP*countT就是PAT的个数


```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#define N 1000000007
using namespace std;
int main() {
	string str; cin>>str;
	int countP = 0, countA = 0, countT = 0;
	long long sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
		if (str[i] == 'T')
			countT++;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
		if (str[i] == 'P')
			countP++;
		if (str[i] == 'T')
			countT--;
		if (str[i] == 'A')
			sum = (sum + (countP*countT) % N) % N;
	}
	cout << sum;
	return 0;
}
```
