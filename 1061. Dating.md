# 1061 Dating （20 分)

Sherlock Holmes received a note with some strange strings: `Let's date! 3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&hgsfdk d&Hyscvnm`. It took him only a minute to figure out that those strange strings are actually referring to the coded time `Thursday 14:04` \-\- since the first common capital English letter (case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter `D`, representing the 4th day in a week; the second common character is the 5th capital letter `E`, representing the 14th hour (hence the hours from 0 to 23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters from `A` to `N`, respectively); and the English letter shared by the last two strings is `s` at the 4th position, representing the 4th minute. Now given two pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode the dating time.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives 4 non-empty strings of no more than 60 characters without white space in 4 lines.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the decoded time in one line, in the format `DAY HH:MM`, where `DAY` is a 3-character abbreviation for the days in a week -- that is, `MON` for Monday, `TUE` for Tuesday, `WED` for Wednesday, `THU` for Thursday, `FRI` for Friday, `SAT` for Saturday, and `SUN` for Sunday. It is guaranteed that the result is unique for each case.

### Sample Input:

    3485djDkxh4hhGE 
    2984akDfkkkkggEdsb 
    s&hgsfdk 
    d&Hyscvnm
    

### Sample Output:

    THU 14:04

### 题目解析

- 第一二个字符串首先找到第一个重叠的字母（大小写敏感）其下标就是 **日期**
- 再从第一个重叠字母之后继续遍历，第二个重叠的字母或数字就是 **小时**
- 从第三第四个字符串找到第一个重叠的字母就是 **分钟**

注意查找小时的时候遇到重复的数字或字母，如果是字母的时候需要转换一下：

```C++
   if (s1[i] == s2[i] && ((s1[i] = 'A'&&s1[i] <= 'N') || isdigit(s1[i]))) {
       if (isdigit(s1[i]))
	    hour = s1[i] - '0';
       else
             hour = s1[i] - 'A' + 10;
       break;
}
```

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	string DayCode[7] = { "MON ", "TUE ", "WED ", "THU ", "FRI ", "SAT ", "SUN " };
	string s1, s2, s3, s4; cin >> s1 >> s2 >> s3 >> s4;
	int min1 = min(s1.length(), s2.length());
	int min2 = min(s3.length(), s4.length());
	int index, hour, minute;
	for (int i = 0; i < min1; i++) {
		if (s1[i] == s2[i] && s1[i] >= 'A'&&s2[i] <= 'G') {
			index = i;
			cout << DayCode[s1[i] - 'A'];
			break;
		}
	}
	for (int i = index + 1; i < min1; i++) {
		if (s1[i] == s2[i] && ((s1[i] >= 'A'&&s1[i] <= 'N') || isdigit(s1[i]))) {
			if (isdigit(s1[i]))
				hour = s1[i] - '0';
			else
				hour = s1[i] - 'A' + 10;
			break;
		}
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < min2; i++) {
		if (s3[i] == s4[i] && isalpha(s3[i])) {
			minute = i;
			break;
		}
	}
	printf("%02d:%02d", hour, minute);
	return 0;
}
