### 题目描述

> For a student taking the online course "Data Structures" on China University MOOC (http://www.icourse163.org/), to be qualified for a certificate, he/she must first obtain no less than 200 points from the online programming assignments, and then receive a final grade no less than 60 out of 100. The final grade is calculated by G=(G
​mid−term
​​ ×40%+G
​final
​​ ×60%) if G
​mid−term
​​ >G
​final
​​ , or G
​final
​​  will be taken as the final grade G. Here G
​mid−term
​​  and G
​final
​​  are the student's scores of the mid-term and the final exams, respectively.
>
>The problem is that different exams have different grading sheets. Your job is to write a program to merge all the grading sheets into one.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers: P , the number of students having done the online programming assignments; M, the number of students on the mid-term list; and N, the number of students on the final exam list. All the numbers are no more than 10,000.
>
>Then three blocks follow. The first block contains P online programming scores G
​p
​​ 's; the second one contains M mid-term scores G
​mid−term
​​ 's; and the last one contains N final exam scores G
​final
​​ 's. Each score occupies a line with the format: StudentID Score, where StudentID is a string of no more than 20 English letters and digits, and Score is a nonnegative integer (the maximum score of the online programming is 900, and that of the mid-term and final exams is 100).


### 输出描述:
> For each case, print the list of students who are qualified for certificates. Each student occupies a line with the format:
>
>StudentID G
​p
​​  G
​mid−term
​​  G
​final
​​  G
>
>If some score does not exist, output "−1" instead. The output must be sorted in descending order of their final grades (G must be rounded up to an integer). If there is a tie, output in ascending order of their StudentID's. It is guaranteed that the StudentID's are all distinct, and there is at least one qullified student.

## 题目解析
>可以利用map，当Gp<200时，就不需要加入map了，计算最后的G时注意四舍五入round()
>
>```C++
>data[id].G = round(data[id].Gmid*0.4 + data[id].Gfinal*0.6);
>```
>将符合规定的数据放入vector排序
