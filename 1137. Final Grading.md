# 1137 Final Grading （25 分)

For a student taking the online course "Data Structures" on China University MOOC ([http://www.icourse163.org/](http://www.icourse163.org/)), to be qualified for a certificate, he/she must first obtain no less than 200 points from the online programming assignments, and then receive a final grade no less than 60 out of 100. The final grade is calculated by G=(Gmid−term×40%+Gfinal×60%)G = (G_{mid-term}\\times 40\\% + G_{final}\\times 60\\%)G=(G​mid−term​​×40%+G​final​​×60%) if Gmid−term>GfinalG_{mid-term} > G_{final}G​mid−term​​>G​final​​, or GfinalG_{final}G​final​​ will be taken as the final grade GGG. Here Gmid−termG_{mid-term}G​mid−term​​ and GfinalG_{final}G​final​​ are the student's scores of the mid-term and the final exams, respectively.

The problem is that different exams have different grading sheets. Your job is to write a program to merge all the grading sheets into one.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers: P , the number of students having done the online programming assignments; M, the number of students on the mid-term list; and N, the number of students on the final exam list. All the numbers are no more than 10,000.

Then three blocks follow. The first block contains P online programming scores GpG_pG​p​​'s; the second one contains M mid-term scores Gmid−termG_{mid-term}G​mid−term​​'s; and the last one contains N final exam scores GfinalG_{final}G​final​​'s. Each score occupies a line with the format: `StudentID Score`, where `StudentID` is a string of no more than 20 English letters and digits, and `Score` is a nonnegative integer (the maximum score of the online programming is 900, and that of the mid-term and final exams is 100).

### Output Specification:

For each case, print the list of students who are qualified for certificates. Each student occupies a line with the format:

`StudentID` GpG_pG​p​​ Gmid−termG_{mid-term}G​mid−term​​ GfinalG_{final}G​final​​ GGG

If some score does not exist, output "−1-1−1" instead. The output must be sorted in descending order of their final grades (GGG must be rounded up to an integer). If there is a tie, output in ascending order of their `StudentID`'s. It is guaranteed that the `StudentID`'s are all distinct, and there is at least one qullified student.

### Sample Input:

    6 6 7
    01234 880
    a1903 199
    ydjh2 200
    wehu8 300
    dx86w 220
    missing 400
    ydhfu77 99
    wehu8 55
    ydjh2 98
    dx86w 88
    a1903 86
    01234 39
    ydhfu77 88
    a1903 66
    01234 58
    wehu8 84
    ydjh2 82
    missing 99
    dx86w 81
    

### Sample Output:

    missing 400 -1 99 99
    ydjh2 200 98 82 88
    dx86w 220 88 81 84
    wehu8 300 55 84 84

### 题目解析

可以利用map，当Gp<200时，就不需要加入map了，计算最后的G时注意四舍五入round()

```C++
data[id].G = round(data[id].Gmid*0.4 + data[id].Gfinal*0.6);
```
将符合规定的数据放入vector排序

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include<vector>
#include<map>
#include<algorithm>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
struct Score{
	int Gp = -1, Gmid = -1, Gfinal = -1, G = -1;
};
struct Student{
	string id; Score score;
};
bool HigerG(Student s1, Student s2) {
	return s1.score.G != s2.score.G ? (s1.score.G > s2.score.G) : (s1.id < s2.id);
}
int main() {
	int p, m, n, tempScore; cin >> p >> m >> n;
	map<string, Score> data; Score temp; string id;
	vector<Student> output;
	for (int i = 0; i < p; i++) {
		cin >> id >> temp.Gp;
		if (temp.Gp >= 200)
			data.insert(pair<string, Score>(id, temp));
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> id >> tempScore;
		if (data.find(id) != data.end())
			data[id].Gmid = tempScore;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> id >> tempScore;
		if (data.find(id) != data.end()) {
			data[id].Gfinal = tempScore; data[id].G = data[id].Gfinal;
			if (data[id].Gmid > data[id].Gfinal)
				data[id].G = round(data[id].Gmid*0.4 + data[id].Gfinal*0.6);
			if (data[id].G >= 60)
				output.push_back(Student{ id, data[id] });
		}
	}
	sort(output.begin(), output.end(), HigerG);
	for (int i = 0; i < output.size(); i++)
		cout << output[i].id << " " << output[i].score.Gp << " " << output[i].score.Gmid << " " << output[i].score.Gfinal << " " << output[i].score.G << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
