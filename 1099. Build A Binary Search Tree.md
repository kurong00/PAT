# 1099 Build A Binary Search Tree （30 分)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST. You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of that tree. The sample is illustrated by Figure 1 and 2.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer NNN (≤100\\le 100≤100) which is the total number of nodes in the tree. The next NNN lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the format `left_index right_index`, provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to N−1N-1N−1, and 0 is always the root. If one child is missing, then −1-1−1 will represent the NULL child pointer. Finally NNN distinct integer keys are given in the last line.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree. All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    9
    1 6
    2 3
    -1 -1
    -1 4
    5 -1
    -1 -1
    7 -1
    -1 8
    -1 -1
    73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
    

### Sample Output:

    58 25 82 11 38 67 45 73 42

### 题目解析

- 首先将 value 数组根据大小顺序排成有序序列
- 因为BST树中序遍历的话就是有序序列，因此在中序遍历的时候赋值
- 根据index排序，输出的就是层序

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
const int N = 101;
using namespace std;
struct node {
	int data, index, left, right, level;
}tree[N];
int n, cnt, value[N];
void DFS(int root, int index, int level) {
	if (tree[root].left == -1 && tree[root].right == -1)
		tree[root] = { value[cnt++],index,tree[root].left,tree[root].right,level };
	else {
		if (tree[root].left != -1) DFS(tree[root].left, index * 2 + 1, level + 1);
		tree[root] = { value[cnt++],index,tree[root].left,tree[root].right,level };
		if (tree[root].right != -1) DFS(tree[root].right, index * 2 + 2, level + 1);
	}
}
bool SortIndex(node a, node b) {
	if (a.level != b.level) return a.level < b.level;
	return a.index < b.index;
}
int main() {
	cin >> n;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		cin >> tree[i].left >> tree[i].right;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		cin >> value[i];
	sort(value, value + n);
	DFS(0, 0, 0);
	sort(tree, tree + n, SortIndex);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		cout << tree[i].data << (i != n - 1 ? " " : "");
	return 0;
}
