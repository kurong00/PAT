# 1007. Maximum Subsequence Sum

## 题目描述

> Given a sequence of K integers { N1, N2, ..., NK }. A continuous subsequence is defined to be { Ni, Ni+1, ..., Nj } where 1 <= i <= j <= K. The Maximum Subsequence is the continuous subsequence which has the largest sum of its elements. For example, given sequence { -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2 }, its maximum subsequence is { 11, -4, 13 } with the largest sum being 20.
>
>Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.

## 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines. The first line contains a positive integer K (<= 10000). The second line contains K numbers, separated by a space.

## 输出描述

> For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line. In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices i and j (as shown by the sample case). If all the K numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

## 题目解析

>经典的求最大子序列和：
>
>1. 首先找到序列sum第一次变成**负数**的时候，序列当前的数字pivot，记录下它的index，一个序列可能有多个这样的pivot
>2. sum赋值0后重新开始累加计算
>3. 如果max < sum就更新max的值，同时更新rightIndex

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n; cin >> n;
	vector<int> data(n);
	int max = -1, sum = 0, left = 0, right = n - 1, temp = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> data[i];
		sum += data[i];
		if (sum < 0) {
			sum = 0;
			temp = i + 1;
		}
		else if (max < sum) {
			max = sum;
			left = temp;
			right = i;
		}
	}
	if (max < 0)max = 0;
	cout << max << " " << data[left] << " " << data[right];
	return 0;
}
```
