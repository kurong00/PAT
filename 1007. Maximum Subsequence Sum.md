### 题目描述
> Given a sequence of K integers { N1, N2, ..., NK }. A continuous subsequence is defined to be { Ni, Ni+1, ..., Nj } where 1 <= i <= j <= K. The Maximum Subsequence is the continuous subsequence which has the largest sum of its elements. For example, given sequence { -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2 }, its maximum subsequence is { 11, -4, 13 } with the largest sum being 20.
>
>Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines. The first line contains a positive integer K (<= 10000). The second line contains K numbers, separated by a space.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line. In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices i and j (as shown by the sample case). If all the K numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

## 题目解析
经典的求最大子序列和：
1. 首先找到序列第一个>0的数字pivot，记录下它的index，赋给leftIndex
2. 逐步累加，如果当前的currSum出现的负数，则赋值0重新开始累加计算
3. 如果maxSum < currSum就更新maxSum的值


```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	vector<int> data(n);
	int currSum = 0, maxSum = 0, leftIndex = 0, rightIndex = n - 1, tempIndex = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> data[i];
		currSum += data[i];
		if (currSum < 0) {
			currSum = 0;
			tempIndex = i + 1;
		}
		else if(maxSum < currSum){
			maxSum = currSum;
			leftIndex = tempIndex;
			rightIndex = i;
		}
	}
	cout << maxSum << " " << data[leftIndex] << " " << data[rightIndex];
	return 0;
}
```
