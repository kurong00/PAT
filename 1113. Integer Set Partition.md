### 题目描述

> Given a set of N (> 1) positive integers, you are supposed to partition them into two disjoint sets A~1~ and A~2~ of n~1~ and n~2~ numbers, respectively. Let S~1~ and S~2~ denote the sums of all the numbers in A~1~ and A~2~, respectively. You are supposed to make the partition so that |n~1~ - n~2~| is minimized first, and then |S~1~ - S~2~| is maximized.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives an integer N (2 <= N <= 10^5^), and then N positive integers follow in the next line, separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that all the integers and their sum are less than   
> $$2^{31}$$


### 输出描述:
> For each case, print in a line two numbers: |n~1~ - n~2~| and |S~1~ - S~2~|, separated by exactly one space.

## 题目解析
>1. 题目大意是将数组分为两个集合，使得两个集合的**集合中包含的数字的个数**差异最小，且两个集合分别的sum相差 |sum1-sum2| 达到最大
>
>2. 首先对数组排序，确认中间数mid
>
>3. mid-n累加为sum2，0-mid-1累加为sum1，相减即是答案。

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n; cin >> n;
	vector<int> data(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		cin >> data[i];
	sort(data.begin(), data.end());
	int mid = n / 2;
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = mid; i < n; i++)
		sum += data[i];
	for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++)
		sum -= data[i];
	cout << n % 2 << " " << sum << endl;
	return 0;
}
