### 题目描述

> The task is really simple: given N exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains an integer N (in [3, 10^5^]), followed by N integer distances D~1~ D~2~ ... D~N~, where D~i~ is the distance between the i-th and the (i+1)-st exits, and D~N~ is between the N-th and the 1st exits. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive integer M (<=10^4^), with M lines follow, each contains a pair of exit 1 to N. It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 10^7^.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, print your results in M lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.

## 题目解析
因为n个数可以构成一个环，输入的a b两个数把环分成了两半，比较两半的大小输出即可

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n, m, a, b, sum = 0, temp; cin >> n;
	vector<int> data(n + 1, 0);
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		cin >> temp;
		sum += temp;
		data[i] = sum;
	}
	cin >> m;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> a >> b;
		if (a > b)
			swap(a, b);
		cout << min((sum - (data[b - 1] - data[a - 1])), (data[b - 1] - data[a - 1])) << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

```
