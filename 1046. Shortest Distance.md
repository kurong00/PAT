# 1046 Shortest Distance （20 分)

The task is really simple: given NNN exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains an integer NNN (in \[3,1053, 10^53,10​5​​\]), followed by NNN integer distances D1D_1D​1​​ D2D_2D​2​​ ⋯\\cdots⋯ DND_ND​N​​, where DiD_iD​i​​ is the distance between the iii-th and the (i+1)(i+1)(i+1)-st exits, and DND_ND​N​​ is between the NNN-th and the 1st exits. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive integer MMM (≤104\\le 10^4≤10​4​​), with MMM lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to NNN. It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 10710^710​7​​.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in MMM lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.

### Sample Input:

    5 1 2 4 14 9
    3
    1 3
    2 5
    4 1
    

### Sample Output:

    3
    10
    7

### 题目解析

因为n个数可以构成一个环，输入的a b两个数把环分成了两半，比较两半的大小输出即可

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n, m, a, b, sum = 0, temp; cin >> n;
	vector<int> data(n + 1, 0);
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		cin >> temp;
		sum += temp;
		data[i] = sum;
	}
	cin >> m;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> a >> b;
		if (a > b)
			swap(a, b);
		cout << min((sum - (data[b - 1] - data[a - 1])), (data[b - 1] - data[a - 1])) << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

```
