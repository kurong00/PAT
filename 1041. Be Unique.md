# 1041 Be Unique （20 分)

Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from \[1,1041, 10^41,10​4​​\]. The first one who bets on a unique number wins. For example, if there are 7 people betting on { 5 31 5 88 67 88 17 }, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a line which begins with a positive integer NNN (≤105\\le 10^5≤10​5​​) and then followed by NNN bets. The numbers are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the winning number in a line. If there is no winner, print `None` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

    7 5 31 5 88 67 88 17
    

### Sample Output 1:

    31
    

### Sample Input 2:

    5 888 666 666 888 888
    

### Sample Output 2:

    None

### 题目解析

找出**第一个**独一无二的数字。同样的方法用vector有两个点过不去，用数组可以

```C++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	int data1[100001] = { 0 }, data2[100000] = { 0 };
	int temp;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> data1[i];
		data2[data1[i]]++;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		if (data2[data1[i]] == 1) {
			cout << data1[i];
			return 0;
		}
	}
	cout << "None";
	return 0;
}

```
