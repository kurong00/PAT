# 1134 Vertex Cover （25 分)

A **vertex cover** of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. Now given a graph with several vertex sets, you are supposed to tell if each of them is a vertex cover or not.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers NNN and MMM (both no more than 10410^410​4​​), being the total numbers of vertices and the edges, respectively. Then MMM lines follow, each describes an edge by giving the indices (from 0 to N−1N-1N−1) of the two ends of the edge.

After the graph, a positive integer KKK (≤\\le≤ 100) is given, which is the number of queries. Then KKK lines of queries follow, each in the format:

NvN_vN​v​​ v\[1\]v\[1\]v\[1\] v\[2\]⋯v\[Nv\]v\[2\] \\cdots v\[N_v\]v\[2\]⋯v\[N​v​​\]

where NvN_vN​v​​ is the number of vertices in the set, and v\[i\]v\[i\]v\[i\]'s are the indices of the vertices.

### Output Specification:

For each query, print in a line `Yes` if the set is a vertex cover, or `No` if not.

### Sample Input:

    10 11
    8 7
    6 8
    4 5
    8 4
    8 1
    1 2
    1 4
    9 8
    9 1
    1 0
    2 4
    5
    4 0 3 8 4
    6 6 1 7 5 4 9
    3 1 8 4
    2 2 8
    7 9 8 7 6 5 4 2
    

### Sample Output:

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    No

### 题目解析

- 建图的时候将输入的点 `(a,b)` 记为第 `i` 条边的端点

```c++
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int a, b; cin >> a >> b;
            graph[a].push_back(i);
            graph[b].push_back(i);
        }
```

- 检查查询点时利用hash值来查是否有没有出现的点

```c++
    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
		int num; cin >> num;
		for (int j = 0; j < graph[num].size(); j++) {
			hash[graph[num][j]] = 1;
		}
	}
```

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int n, m, k;
vector<vector<int>> graph;
void Check() {
	int t; cin >> t;
	vector<int> hash(m, 0);
	for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
		int num; cin >> num;
		for (int j = 0; j < graph[num].size(); j++) {
			hash[graph[num][j]] = 1;
		}
	}
	for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
		if (hash[j] == 0) {
			cout << "No" << endl;
			return;
		}
	cout << "Yes" << endl;
}
int main() {
	cin >> n >> m;
	graph.resize(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int a, b; cin >> a >> b;
		graph[a].push_back(i);
		graph[b].push_back(i);
	}
	cin >> k;
	for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
		Check();
	return 0;
}
```
