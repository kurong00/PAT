# 1104 Sum of Number Segments （20 分)

Given a sequence of positive numbers, a segment is defined to be a consecutive subsequence. For example, given the sequence { 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 }, we have 10 segments: (0.1) (0.1, 0.2) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.2) (0.2, 0.3) (0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.3) (0.3, 0.4) and (0.4).

Now given a sequence, you are supposed to find the sum of all the numbers in all the segments. For the previous example, the sum of all the 10 segments is 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.3 + 0.7 + 0.4 = 5.0.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer NNN, the size of the sequence which is no more than 10510^510​5​​. The next line contains NNN positive numbers in the sequence, each no more than 1.0, separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the sum of all the numbers in all the segments, accurate up to 2 decimal places.

### Sample Input:

    4
    0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4
    

### Sample Output:

    5.00

### 题目解析

显然硬编码会超时，这里注意每个数字出现的频率可以通过下列公式来计算：
```C++
    (i + 1)*(n - i)
```


```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n; cin >> n;
	double sum = 0;
	vector<double> data(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		cin >> data[i];
		sum += data[i] * (i + 1)*(n - i);
	}
	cout << setprecision(2) << fixed << sum;
	return 0;
}
```
