### 题目描述

> Given a sequence of positive numbers, a segment is defined to be a consecutive subsequence. For example, given the sequence {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, we have 10 segments: (0.1) (0.1, 0.2) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.2) (0.2, 0.3) (0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.3) (0.3, 0.4) (0.4).
>
>Now given a sequence, you are supposed to find the sum of all the numbers in all the segments. For the previous example, the sum of all the 10 segments is 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.3 + 0.7 + 0.4 = 5.0.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N, the size of the sequence which is no more than 10^5^. The next line contains N positive numbers in the sequence, each no more than 1.0, separated by a space.

### 输出描述:
> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N, the size of the sequence which is no more than 10^5^. The next line contains N positive numbers in the sequence, each no more than 1.0, separated by a space.

### 输入例子
> 4
>
>0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 

### 输出例子
> 5.00

## 题目解析
显然硬编码会超时，这里注意每个数字出现的频率可以通过公式：
```C++
    (i + 1)*(n - i)
```
来计算

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n; cin >> n;
	double sum = 0;
	vector<double> data(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		cin >> data[i];
		sum += data[i] * (i + 1)*(n - i);
	}
	cout << setprecision(2) << fixed << sum;
	return 0;
}
```
