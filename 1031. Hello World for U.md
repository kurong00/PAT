# 1031 Hello World for U （20 分)

Given any string of NNN (≥5\\ge 5≥5) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of `U`. For example, `helloworld` can be printed as:

    h  d
    e  l
    l  r
    lowo
    

That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical line with n1n_1n​1​​ characters, then left to right along the bottom line with n2n_2n​2​​ characters, and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with n3n_3n​3​​ characters. And more, we would like `U` to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that n1=n3=maxn\_1 = n\_3 = maxn​1​​=n​3​​=max { kkk | k≤n2k \\le n_2k≤n​2​​ for all 3≤n2≤N3 \\le n_2 \\le N3≤n​2​​≤N } with n1+n2+n3−2=Nn\_1 + n\_2 + n_3 - 2 = Nn​1​​+n​2​​+n​3​​−2=N.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line. The string contains no white space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.

### Sample Input:

    helloworld!
    

### Sample Output:

    h   !
    e   d
    l   l
    lowor

### 题目解析

唯一需要注意的点是行n1，列n2的计算方式
```C++
    int n1 = (n + 2) / 3;
    int n2 = n + 2 - n1 * 2;
```

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	string s;
	cin >> s;
	int n = s.length();
	int n1 = (n + 2) / 3, n2 = n + 2 - n1 * 2;
	for (int i = 0; i < n1 - 1; i++) {
		cout << s[i];
		for (int j = 0; j < n2 - 2; j++) {
			cout << " ";
		}
		cout << s[n - 1 - i];
		cout << endl;
	}
	for (int i = n1 - 1; i < n1 + n2 - 1; i++)
		cout << s[i];
	return 0;
}
```
