### 题目描述

> A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0 < N < 100, the number of nodes in a tree, and M (< N), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then M lines follow, each in the format: 
> 
> ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
>
> where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child for every seniority level starting from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line. 
> 
> The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where 01 is the root and 02 is its only child. Hence on the root 01 level, there is 0 leaf node; and on the next level, there is 1 leaf node. Then we should output "0 1" in a line.

### 输入例子
> 2 1
> 
> 01 1 02

### 输出例子
> 0 1

## 题目解析
题目要求输出每层没有孩子的节点数，定义一个树节点表示孩子的数目和所在的层次数，遍历一遍后找出最后有孩子结点的层，再打印出来。


```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
#define ROOT 01
struct TreeNode
{
	int childNumber;
	int level;
};
int main() {
	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;
	vector<TreeNode> tree(n + 1, TreeNode());
	vector<int> leaf(n + 1, 0);
	int parentID, childNum, childID;
	tree[ROOT].level = 1;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> parentID;
		cin >> childNum;
		for (int j = 0; j < childNum; j++) {
			cin >> childID;
			tree[parentID].childNumber = childNum;
			tree[childID].level = tree[parentID].level + 1;
		}
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (tree[i].childNumber == 0)
			leaf[tree[i].level]++;
	}
	int lastHasChildNode = 0;
	for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
		if (leaf[i] != 0)
		{
			lastHasChildNode = i;
			break;
		}
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <=lastHasChildNode; i++) {
		cout << leaf[i];
		if (i != lastHasChildNode)
			cout << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
