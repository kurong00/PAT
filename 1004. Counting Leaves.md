# 1004. Counting Leaves

## 题目描述

> A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.

## 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0 < N < 100, the number of nodes in a tree, and M (< N), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then M lines follow, each in the format: 
>
> ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
>
> where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.

## 输出描述

> For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child for every seniority level starting from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line. 
>
> The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where 01 is the root and 02 is its only child. Hence on the root 01 level, there is 0 leaf node; and on the next level, there is 1 leaf node. Then we should output "0 1" in a line.

## 输入例子

> 2 1
>
> 01 1 02

## 输出例子

> 0 1

## 题目解析

>题目要求输出每层没有孩子的节点数，利用DFS来查找，从根节点开始查找，直到遇到没有孩子结点的结点则 **book[depth]++;** 标记第depth层拥有的叶子结点数，最后输出

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
vector<int> treeNode[100];
int book[100], maxDepth = -1;
void DFS(int index, int depth) {
	if (treeNode[index].size() == 0) {
		//遇到叶子结点
		book[depth]++;
		maxDepth = max(maxDepth, depth);
		return;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < treeNode[index].size(); i++)
		DFS(treeNode[index][i], depth + 1);
}
int main() {
	int n, m, childCount, tempNode, childNode;
	cin >> n >> m;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> tempNode >> childCount;
		for (int j = 0; j < childCount; j++) {
			cin >> childNode;
			treeNode[tempNode].push_back(childNode);
		}
	}
	DFS(1, 0);
	cout << book[0];
	for (int i = 1; i <= maxDepth; i++)
		cout <<" "<< book[i];
	return 0;
}
```
