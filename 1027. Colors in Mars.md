# 1027 Colors in Mars （20 分)

People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the Earth people. That is, a color is represented by a 6-digit number, where the first 2 digits are for `Red`, the middle 2 digits for `Green`, and the last 2 digits for `Blue`. The only difference is that they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C) instead of 16. Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and 168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the three decimal color values.

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following format: first output `#`, then followed by a 6-digit number where all the English characters must be upper-cased. If a single color is only 1-digit long, you must print a `0` to its left.

### Sample Input:

    15 43 71
    

### Sample Output:

    #123456

### 题目解析

由于输入的最大数字只有168，所以直接通过
```C++
int a = x / 13;
int b = x % 13;
```
来计算换算的十三进制

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#include<vector>
#include<stack>
using namespace std;
string code[13] = { "0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","A","B","C" };
void Change(int &x) {
	int a = x / 13;
	int b = x % 13;
	cout << code[a] << code[b];
}
int main() {
	int a, b, c;
	cin >> a >> b >> c;
	cout << "#";
	Change(a);
	Change(b);
	Change(c);
	return 0;
}
```
