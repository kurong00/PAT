# 1118 Birds in Forest （25 分）

Some scientists took pictures of thousands of birds in a forest. Assume that all the birds appear in the same picture belong to the same tree. You are supposed to help the scientists to count the maximum number of trees in the forest, and for any pair of birds, tell if they are on the same tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive number NNN (≤104\\le 10^4≤10​4​​) which is the number of pictures. Then NNN lines follow, each describes a picture in the format:

KKK B1B_1B​1​​ B2B_2B​2​​ ... BKB_KB​K​​

where KKK is the number of birds in this picture, and BiB_iB​i​​'s are the indices of birds. It is guaranteed that the birds in all the pictures are numbered continuously from 1 to some number that is no more than 10410^410​4​​.

After the pictures there is a positive number QQQ (≤104\\le 10^4≤10​4​​) which is the number of queries. Then QQQ lines follow, each contains the indices of two birds.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first output in a line the maximum possible number of trees and the number of birds. Then for each query, print in a line `Yes` if the two birds belong to the same tree, or `No` if not.

### Sample Input:

    4
    3 10 1 2
    2 3 4
    4 1 5 7 8
    3 9 6 4
    2
    10 5
    3 7
    

### Sample Output:

    2 10
    Yes
    No

### 题目解析

- 并查集的使用
- FindFather利用路径压缩
- 找tree的个数，可以利用set查找不同的father，father的个数就是tree的个数

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<set>
using namespace std;
const int N = 100001;
int father[N];
int FindFather(int x) {
	int a = x;
	while (x != father[x])
		x = father[x];
	while (a != father[a]) {
		int z = a;
		a = father[a];
		father[z] = x;
	}
	return x;
}
void Union(int a, int b) {
	int fatA = FindFather(a);
	int fatB = FindFather(b);
	if (fatA != fatB)
		father[fatA] = fatB;
}
int main()
{
	int n,max=0; cin >> n;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
		father[i] = i;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int k; cin >> k;
		vector<int> data(k);
		for (int j = 0; j < k; j++){
			cin >> data[j];
			if (data[j] > max)
				max = data[j];
		}
		for (int j = k - 1; j > 0; j--)
			Union(data[j], data[j - 1]);
	}
	int m; cin >> m;
	set<int> tree;
	for (int i = 1; i <= max; i++) {
		int x = FindFather(i);
		tree.insert(x);
	}
	cout << tree.size() << " " << max << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int a, b; cin >> a >> b;
		if (FindFather(a) == FindFather(b))
			cout << "Yes" << endl;
		else
			cout << "No" << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
