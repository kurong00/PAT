# 1072 Gas Station （30 分)

A gas station has to be built at such a location that the minimum distance between the station and any of the residential housing is as far away as possible. However it must guarantee that all the houses are in its service range.

Now given the map of the city and several candidate locations for the gas station, you are supposed to give the best recommendation. If there are more than one solution, output the one with the smallest average distance to all the houses. If such a solution is still not unique, output the one with the smallest index number.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 4 positive integers: NNN (≤103\\le 10^3≤10​3​​), the total number of houses; MMM (≤10\\le 10≤10), the total number of the candidate locations for the gas stations; KKK (≤104\\le 10^4≤10​4​​), the number of roads connecting the houses and the gas stations; and DSD_SD​S​​, the maximum service range of the gas station. It is hence assumed that all the houses are numbered from 1 to NNN, and all the candidate locations are numbered from `G`1 to `G`MMM.

Then KKK lines follow, each describes a road in the format

    P1 P2 Dist
    

where `P1` and `P2` are the two ends of a road which can be either house numbers or gas station numbers, and `Dist` is the integer length of the road.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in the first line the index number of the best location. In the next line, print the minimum and the average distances between the solution and all the houses. The numbers in a line must be separated by a space and be accurate up to 1 decimal place. If the solution does not exist, simply output `No Solution`.

### 题目解析

符合题意的 Gas Station

- 在最大服务距离以内：到最近的居民区 **最远**
- 如果有多个的话取  **到居民区平均距离最短**
- 还要多个的话取 编号最小的Gas Station

让每个加油站，对所有居民区进行Dijkstra，如果有一个超出了服务范围则舍弃加油站。然后根据题意开始筛查，注意输入数据时，两个节点之间可能有多条边，选最短的一条进行赋值
