### 题目描述

> Behind the scenes in the computer's memory, color is always talked about as a series of 24 bits of information for each pixel. In an image, the color with the largest proportional area is called the dominant color. A strictly dominant color takes more than half of the total area. Now given an image of resolution M by N (for example, 800x600), you are supposed to point out the strictly dominant color.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: M (<=800) and N (<=600) which are the resolutions of the image. Then N lines follow, each contains M digital colors in the range [0, 224). It is guaranteed that the strictly dominant color exists for each input image. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, simply print the dominant color in a line.

## 题目解析
找出数组中出现频率占数组个数一半以上的数字。发现用cin有一个测试点会超时，改用
```C++
    scanf("%d", &temp);
```

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include<map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int N, M, temp;
	cin >> M >> N;
	int half = N * M / 2;
	map<int, int> data;
	for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
			scanf("%d", &temp);
			data[temp]++;
			if (data[temp] >= half) {
				cout << temp;
				return 0;
			}
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```
