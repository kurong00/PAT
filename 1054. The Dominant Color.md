### 题目描述

> Behind the scenes in the computer's memory, color is always talked about as a series of 24 bits of information for each pixel. In an image, the color with the largest proportional area is called the dominant color. A strictly dominant color takes more than half of the total area. Now given an image of resolution M by N (for example, 800x600), you are supposed to point out the strictly dominant color.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: M (<=800) and N (<=600) which are the resolutions of the image. Then N lines follow, each contains M digital colors in the range [0, 224). It is guaranteed that the strictly dominant color exists for each input image. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, simply print the dominant color in a line.

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int N,M;
    cin>>M>>N;
    vector<int> data;
    for(int i=0;i<M;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<N;j++){
            int x;
            cin>>x;
            data.push_back(x);
        }
    }
    sort(data.begin(),data.end());
    cout<<data[(data.size()+1)/2];
    return 0;
}
