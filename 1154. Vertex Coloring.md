# 1154. Vertex Coloring

A **proper vertex coloring** is a labeling of the graph's vertices with colors such that no two vertices sharing the same edge have the same color. A coloring using at most kkk colors is called a (proper) **kkk-coloring**.

Now you are supposed to tell if a given coloring is a proper kkk-coloring.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers NNN and MMM (both no more than 10410^410​4​​), being the total numbers of vertices and edges, respectively. Then MMM lines follow, each describes an edge by giving the indices (from 0 to N−1N-1N−1) of the two ends of the edge.

After the graph, a positive integer KKK (≤\\le≤ 100) is given, which is the number of colorings you are supposed to check. Then KKK lines follow, each contains NNN colors which are represented by non-negative integers in the range of **int**. The iii-th color is the color of the iii-th vertex.

### Output Specification:

For each coloring, print in a line `k-coloring` if it is a proper `k`-coloring for some positive `k`, or `No` if not.

### Sample Input:

    10 11
    8 7
    6 8
    4 5
    8 4
    8 1
    1 2
    1 4
    9 8
    9 1
    1 0
    2 4
    4
    0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 3 0
    0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 0
    8 1 0 1 4 1 0 5 3 0
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 9

### Sample Output:

    4-coloring
    No
    6-coloring
    No

### 题目解析

题目有一些难理解，大意是：

- 输入一堆边，构成一张图，这里简单定义一个数据结构Line来存储
- 接着输入一堆颜色用set记下，它们的顺序代表把颜色涂上顶点的顺序
- 逐个比对，如果出现重复的则表示No，否则输出set集合中的个数
- 例如第二行，结果为No：0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 0，则是第六个元素和第八个元素颜色都是 **0** ，但是6 - 8是相连的

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<set>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
struct Line
{
	int a, b;
};
int main() {
	int n, m; cin >> n >> m;
	vector<Line> graph(m);
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
		cin >> graph[i].a >> graph[i].b;
	int k; cin >> k;
	while (k--){
		int color[10005] = { 0 };
		set<int> colorSet;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			cin >> color[i];
			colorSet.insert(color[i]);
		}
		int flag = 1;
		for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			if (color[graph[i].a] == color[graph[i].b]) {
				flag = 0;
				break;
			}
		}
		if (flag == 1)
			cout << colorSet.size() << "-coloring" << endl;
		else
			cout << "No" << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
