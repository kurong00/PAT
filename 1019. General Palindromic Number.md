### 题目描述

> A number that will be the same when it is written forwards or backwards is known as a Palindromic Number. For example, 1234321 is a palindromic number. All single digit numbers are palindromic numbers.
>
> Although palindromic numbers are most often considered in the decimal system, the concept of palindromicity can be applied to the natural numbers in any numeral system. Consider a number N > 0 in base b >= 2, where it is written in standard notation with k+1 digits ai as the sum of (aibi) for i from 0 to k. Here, as usual, 0 <= ai < b for all i and ak is non-zero. Then N is palindromic if and only if ai = ak-i for all i. Zero is written 0 in any base and is also palindromic by definition.
>
>Given any non-negative decimal integer N and a base b, you are supposed to tell if N is a palindromic number in base b.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two non-negative numbers N and b, where 0 <= N <= 109 is the decimal number and 2 <= b <= 109 is the base. The numbers are separated by a space.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, first print in one line "Yes" if N is a palindromic number in base b, or "No" if not. Then in the next line, print N as the number in base b in the form "ak ak-1 ... a0". Notice that there must be no extra space at the end of output.

### 输入例子
> 27  2

### 输出例子
> Yes
> 
> 1 1 0 1 1


## 题目解析

1. 在判断回文数字的时候，从两端向中间判断，只需要判断数组的一半次数即可：
    ```C++
        for (int i = 0; i < index / 2; i++)
    ```
    利用flag标记是否有回文，当出现一个对称位置不相同时立刻跳出
    ```C++
        if (data[i] != data[index - i - 1])
		{
			flag = false;
			break;
		}+;
    ```

```C++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int number, base;
	cin >> number >> base;
	int data[20];
	int index = 0;
	if (number <= base) {
		cout << "Yes" << endl << number;
		return 0;
	}
	while (number)
	{
		data[index++] = number % base;
		number /= base;
	}
	bool flag = true;
	for (int i = 0; i < index / 2; i++)
	{
		if (data[i] != data[index - i - 1])
		{
			flag = false;
			break;
		}
	}
	cout << (flag ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;;
	for (int i = index - 1; i >= 0; i--)
	{
		cout << data[i];
		if (i != 0)
			cout << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
```
