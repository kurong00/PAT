# 1121 Damn Single （25 分)

"Damn Single (单身狗)" is the Chinese nickname for someone who is being single. You are supposed to find those who are alone in a big party, so they can be taken care of.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (≤\\le≤ 50,000), the total number of couples. Then N lines of the couples follow, each gives a couple of ID's which are 5-digit numbers (i.e. from 00000 to 99999). After the list of couples, there is a positive integer M (≤\\le≤ 10,000) followed by M ID's of the party guests. The numbers are separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that nobody is having bigamous marriage (重婚) or dangling with more than one companion.

### Output Specification:

First print in a line the total number of lonely guests. Then in the next line, print their ID's in increasing order. The numbers must be separated by exactly 1 space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    3
    11111 22222
    33333 44444
    55555 66666
    7
    55555 44444 10000 88888 22222 11111 23333
    

### Sample Output:

    5
    10000 23333 44444 55555 88888

### 题目解析

- 建立结构体, **myCouple** 代表伴侣的ID，**attend** 代表是否到场 
```C++
struct Couple {
   int myCouple = 0; bool meHasVisit = false;
};
```

- 注意当发现有一对Couple时，人数需要-2
```C++
if (couple[couple[tempMe].myCouple].attend)
       count -= 2;


```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define N 100000
struct Couple {
	int myCouple = 0; bool attend = false;
};
int main() {
	int n, tempMe, tempCouple, m, count = 0; cin >> n;
	Couple couple[N];
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> tempMe >> tempCouple;
		couple[tempMe].myCouple = tempCouple;
		couple[tempCouple].myCouple = tempMe;
	}
	cin >> m;
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> tempMe;
		count++;
		couple[tempMe].attend = true;
		if (couple[couple[tempMe].myCouple].attend)
			count -= 2;
	}
	cout << count << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
		if (couple[i].attend && !couple[couple[i].myCouple].attend) {
			count--;
			if (count != 0)
				printf("%05d ", i);
			else
				printf("%05d", i);
		}
	return 0;
}
```
