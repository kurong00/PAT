### 题目描述

> The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes U and V in a tree is the deepest node that has both U and V as descendants.
>
>A binary search tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:
>
>- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
>- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
>- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
>Given any two nodes in a BST, you are supposed to find their LCA.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: M (≤ 1,000), the number of pairs of nodes to be tested; and N (≤ 10,000), the number of keys in the BST, respectively. In the second line, N distinct integers are given as the preorder traversal sequence of the BST. Then M lines follow, each contains a pair of integer keys U and V. All the keys are in the range of int.


### 输出描述:
> For each given pair of U and V, print in a line LCA of U and V is A. if the LCA is found and A is the key. But if A is one of U and V, print X is an ancestor of Y. where X is A and Y is the other node. If U or V is not found in the BST, print in a line ERROR: U is not found. or ERROR: V is not found. or ERROR: U and V are not found..

### 输入例子
> 6 8<br>
6 3 1 2 5 4 8 7<br>

1 9<br>
12 -3<br>
0 8<br>
99 99<br>

### 输出例子
>LCA of 2 and 5 is 3.<br>
8 is an ancestor of 7.<br>
ERROR: 9 is not found.<br>
ERROR: 12 and -3 are not found.<br>
ERROR: 0 is not found.<br>
ERROR: 99 and 99 are not found.<br>

### 题目解析

- 利用map记录出现过的数字，首先判断筛出掉一些不存在的u,v
- 当u,v都存在时，从前序序列逐个遍历
   - 如果当前  preOrder[i] 夹在 u,v 之间 ：找到目前的LCA，输出preOrder[i]的值
    - 如果当前  preOrder[i] == u 或 v ：u 是 v 的 LCA，或 v 是 u的 LCA

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
map<int, int> number;
vector<int> preOrder;
int m, n, u, v; 
void LCA(int u,int v) {
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (preOrder[i] < u && preOrder[i] > v || preOrder[i] < v && preOrder[i] > u){
			printf("LCA of %d and %d is %d.\n", u, v, preOrder[i]);
			break;
		}
		else if (preOrder[i] == u) {
			printf("%d is an ancestor of %d.\n", u, v);
			break;
		}
		else if(preOrder[i] == v) {
			printf("%d is an ancestor of %d.\n", v, u);
			break;
		}
	}
}
int main() {
	cin >> m >> n;
	preOrder.resize(n + 1);
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		cin >> preOrder[i];
		number[preOrder[i]] = i;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		cin >> u >> v;
		if (number[u] == 0 && number[v] == 0)
			printf("ERROR: %d and %d are not found.\n", u, v);
		else if (number[u] == 0)
			printf("ERROR: %d is not found.\n", u);
		else if (number[v] == 0)
			printf("ERROR: %d is not found.\n", v);
		else
			LCA(u, v);
	}
	return 0;
}
