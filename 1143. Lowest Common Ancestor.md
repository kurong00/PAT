# 1143 Lowest Common Ancestor (30 分)

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes U and V in a tree is the deepest node that has both U and V as descendants.

A binary search tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given any two nodes in a BST, you are supposed to find their LCA.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: M (≤\\le≤ 1,000), the number of pairs of nodes to be tested; and N (≤\\le≤ 10,000), the number of keys in the BST, respectively. In the second line, N distinct integers are given as the preorder traversal sequence of the BST. Then M lines follow, each contains a pair of integer keys U and V. All the keys are in the range of **int**.

### Output Specification:

For each given pair of U and V, print in a line `LCA of U and V is A.` if the LCA is found and `A` is the key. But if `A` is one of U and V, print `X is an ancestor of Y.` where `X` is `A` and `Y` is the other node. If U or V is not found in the BST, print in a line `ERROR: U is not found.` or `ERROR: V is not found.` or `ERROR: U and V are not found.`.

### Sample Input:

    6 8
    6 3 1 2 5 4 8 7
    2 5
    8 7
    1 9
    12 -3
    0 8
    99 99
    

### Sample Output:

    LCA of 2 and 5 is 3.
    8 is an ancestor of 7.
    ERROR: 9 is not found.
    ERROR: 12 and -3 are not found.
    ERROR: 0 is not found.
    ERROR: 99 and 99 are not found.

### 题目解析

* 利用 unordered_map 记录出现过的数字，首先判断筛出掉一些不存在的u,v（因为u,v都有可能是负数，因此不要直接用数组来判断是否存在数字，否则会出现段错误）
* 当u,v都存在时，从前序序列逐个遍历
  * 如果当前  pre[i] 夹在 u,v 之间 ：找到目前的LCA，输出pre[i]的值
  * 如果当前  pre[i] == u 或 v ：u 是 v 的 LCA，或 v 是 u的 LCA

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int m, n;cin >> m >> n;
	vector<int> pre(n);
	unordered_map<int, int> visit;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> pre[i];
		visit[pre[i]] = 1;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		int u, v; cin >> u >> v;
		if (!visit[u] && !visit[v])
			printf("ERROR: %d and %d are not found.\n", u, v);
		else if (!visit[u])
			printf("ERROR: %d is not found.\n", u);
		else if (!visit[v])
			printf("ERROR: %d is not found.\n", v);
		else
			for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
				if (pre[i] < u && pre[i] > v || pre[i] < v && pre[i] > u) {
					printf("LCA of %d and %d is %d.\n", u, v, pre[i]);
					break;
				}
				else if (pre[i] == u) {
					printf("%d is an ancestor of %d.\n", u, v);
					break;
				}
				else if (pre[i] == v) {
					printf("%d is an ancestor of %d.\n", v, u);
					break;
				}
			}
	}
	return 0;
}
