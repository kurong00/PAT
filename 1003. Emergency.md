### 题目描述

> As an emergency rescue team leader of a city, you are given a special map of your country. The map shows several scattered cities connected by some roads. Amount of rescue teams in each city and the length of each road between any pair of cities are marked on the map. When there is an emergency call to you from some other city, your job is to lead your men to the place as quickly as possible, and at the mean time, call up as many hands on the way as possible.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains 4 positive integers: N (<= 500) - the number of cities (and the cities are numbered from 0 to N-1), M - the number of roads, C1 and C2 - the cities that you are currently in and that you must save, respectively. The next line contains N integers, where the i-th integer is the number of rescue teams in the i-th city. Then M lines follow, each describes a road with three integers c1, c2 and L, which are the pair of cities connected by a road and the length of that road, respectively. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one path from C1 to C2

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, print in one line two numbers: the number of different shortest paths between C1 and C2, and the maximum amount of rescue teams you can possibly gather.
All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there is no extra space allowed at the end of a line.

## 题目解析

首先还是看懂一下题目输入：
- 第一行第一个输入N：城市数。
- 第一行第二个输入M：道路数目
- 第一行第三个输入C1：所在的起始城市
- 第一行第四个输入C2：需要去救援的城市
- 第二行：第N个城市的救援队伍数目
- 之后M行:C1（起始城市）、C2（目标城市）、L（间距距离）三个数字组成

题目的输出是：
- 不同最短路径的数量路径
- 最多救援队伍数量

解题注意点： 

1. 这道题目很显然的在考察“最短路径”算法。但是题目中的最短路径并不只有一条，所以需要对原有算法进行稍微修改，以存储多条最短路径及路径信息。
2. 如果系数相加后为0则无需输出。
3. 注意小数点精确到一位。
4. 可以利用map来存储指数和系数的关系

```C++
#include<iostream>       
#include<cstring>    
#include<algorithm>    
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 500;
int main()
{
	int N, M, C1, C2;
	cin >> N >> M >> C1 >> C2;

	int rescueTeam[MAX];
	for (int i = 0; i<N; i++)
		cin >> rescueTeam[i];

	int startCity, endCity, length;
	int map[MAX][MAX];

	for (int i = 0; i<MAX; i++)
		for (int j = 0; j<MAX; j++)
			map[i][j] = -1;

	for (int i = 0; i<M; i++) {
		cin >> startCity >> endCity >> length;
		map[startCity][endCity] = map[endCity][startCity] = length;
	}

	int resultDis[MAX], maxRescueTeam[MAX], rescueTeamDis[MAX];
	for (int i = 0; i<MAX; i++)
		rescueTeamDis[i] = -1;

	resultDis[C1] = 1; maxRescueTeam[C1] = rescueTeam[C1]; rescueTeamDis[C1] = 0;

	int vis[MAX];
	while (true)
	{
		int now = -1;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
		{
			if (!vis[i] && rescueTeamDis[i] != -1)
			{
				if (now == -1)
					now = i;
				else
					now = rescueTeamDis[now] < rescueTeamDis[i] ? now : i;
			}
		}

		if (now == -1) break;
		vis[now] = 1;

		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
		{
			if (map[now][i] != -1)
			{
				if (rescueTeamDis[i] == -1 || rescueTeamDis[i] > rescueTeamDis[now] + map[now][i])
				{
					rescueTeamDis[i] = rescueTeamDis[now] + map[now][i];
					resultDis[i] = resultDis[now];
					maxRescueTeam[i] = maxRescueTeam[now] + rescueTeam[i];
				}
				else if (rescueTeamDis[i] == rescueTeamDis[now] + map[now][i])
				{
					resultDis[i] += resultDis[now];
					maxRescueTeam[i] = max(maxRescueTeam[i], maxRescueTeam[now] + rescueTeam[i]);
				}
			}
		}
	}

	cout << resultDis[C2] << " " << maxRescueTeam[C2];
	return 0;
}
```
