### 题目描述

> After each PAT, the PAT Center will announce the ranking of institutions based on their students' performances. Now you are asked to generate the ranklist.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (≤10 5
​​ ), which is the number of testees. Then N lines follow, each gives the information of a testee in the following format:
>
>ID Score School
>
>where ID is a string of 6 characters with the first one representing the test level: B stands for the basic level, A the advanced level and T the top level; Score is an integer in [0, 100]; and School is the institution code which is a string of no more than 6 English letters (case insensitive). Note: it is guaranteed that ID is unique for each testee.

### 输出描述:
> For each case, first print in a line the total number of institutions. Then output the ranklist of institutions in nondecreasing order of their ranks in the following format:
>
>Rank School TWS Ns
>
>where Rank is the rank (start from 1) of the institution; School is the institution code (all in lower case); ; TWS is the total weighted score which is defined to be the integer part of ScoreB/1.5 + ScoreA + ScoreT*1.5, where ScoreX is the total score of the testees belong to this institution on level X; and Ns is the total number of testees who belong to this institution.
>
>The institutions are ranked according to their TWS. If there is a tie, the institutions are supposed to have the same rank, and they shall be printed in ascending order of Ns. If there is still a tie, they shall be printed in alphabetical order of their codes.

## 题目解析
1. 输入学校的时候都转换为小写，因为输出的学校规定是小写
```C++
transform(data[i].school.begin(), data[i].school.end(), data[i].school.begin(), ::tolower);
```
2. 输出排序的时候，可以先设置一个preTWS记录先前的TWS，如果前一个和后一个相同则rank不需要改变，否则 **rank = i + 1**
3. 由于最后加入vector进行排序，因此之前的map无需顺序，用**unordered_map**比起map时间会少一些

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
#include<algorithm>
#include<unordered_map>
using namespace std;
struct Member {
	string id, school;
	int score;
};
struct Rank {
	int TWS, Ns;
	string School;
};
bool HigerRank(Rank &s1, Rank &s2) {
	if (s1.TWS != s2.TWS)
		return s1.TWS > s2.TWS;
	else if (s1.Ns != s2.Ns)
		return s1.Ns < s2.Ns;
	else
		return s1.School < s2.School;
}
int main() {
	int n, rank = 1, preTWS = 0; cin >> n;
	vector<Member> data(n);
	unordered_map<string, Rank> rankMap;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> data[i].id >> data[i].score >> data[i].school;
		transform(data[i].school.begin(), data[i].school.end(), data[i].school.begin(), ::tolower);
		if (data[i].id[0] == 'B')
			data[i].score /= 1.5;
		if (data[i].id[0] == 'T')
			data[i].score *= 1.5;
		rankMap[data[i].school].Ns++;
		rankMap[data[i].school].School = data[i].school;
		rankMap[data[i].school].TWS += data[i].score;
	}
	vector<Rank> output;
	for (auto it = rankMap.begin(); it != rankMap.end(); it++)
		output.push_back(it->second);
	sort(output.begin(), output.end(), HigerRank);
	cout << output.size() << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < output.size(); i++) {
		if (preTWS != output[i].TWS)
			rank = i + 1;
		preTWS = output[i].TWS;
		cout << rank << " " << output[i].School << " " << output[i].TWS << " " << output[i].Ns << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
