### 题目描述

> Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from [1, 10^4^]. The first one who bets on a unique number wins. For example, if there are 7 people betting on 5 31 5 88 67 88 17, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a line which begins with a positive integer N (<=10^5^) and then followed by N bets. The numbers are separated by a space.

### 输出描述:
> For each test case, print the winning number in a line. If there is no winner, print "None" instead.

### 输入例子
> 7 5 31 5 88 67 88 17

### 输出例子
> 31



## 题目解析
找出**第一个**独一无二的数字。同样的方法用vector有两个点过不去，用数组可以

```C++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	int data1[100001] = { 0 }, data2[100000] = { 0 };
	int temp;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> data1[i];
		data2[data1[i]]++;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		if (data2[data1[i]] == 1) {
			cout << data1[i];
			return 0;
		}
	}
	cout << "None";
	return 0;
}

```
