# Raffle for Weibo Followers （20 分)

John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is, he would select winners from every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are supposed to help him generate the list of winners.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers M (≤\\le≤ 1000), N and S, being the total number of forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the indices start from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white space or return) of a follower who has forwarded John's post.

Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can win more than once. Hence if the current candidate of a winner has won before, we must skip him/her and consider the next one.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input, each nickname occupies a line. If there is no winner yet, print `Keep going...` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

    9 3 2
    Imgonnawin!
    PickMe
    PickMeMeMeee
    LookHere
    Imgonnawin!
    TryAgainAgain

### Sample Input 2:

    Imgonnawin!
    PickMe

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#include<vector>
#include<unordered_set>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int m, n, s,flag=0; cin >> m >> n >> s;
	unordered_set<string> winner;
	vector<string> forwards;
	forwards.push_back("");
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		string str; cin >> str;
		forwards.push_back(str);
	}
	for (int i = s; i < forwards.size(); ) {
		if (s > forwards.size())
			break;
		if (winner.find(forwards[i]) == winner.end()){
			flag = 1;
			cout << forwards[i] << endl;
			winner.insert(forwards[i]);
			i += n;
		}
		else {
			i += 1;
			continue;
		}
	}
	if (flag == 0)
		cout << "Keep going..." << endl;
	return 0;
}
