### 题目描述

> British astronomer Eddington liked to ride a bike. It is said that in order to show off his skill, he has even defined an "Eddington number", E -- that is, the maximum integer E such that it is for E days that one rides more than E miles. Eddington's own E was 87.
>
>Now given everyday's distances that one rides for N days, you are supposed to find the corresponding E (≤N).

### 输入描述

> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (≤10
​5
​​ ), the days of continuous riding. Then N non-negative integers are given in the next line, being the riding distances of everyday.

### 输出描述:
> For each case, print in a line the Eddington number for these N days.

### 输入例子
> 10
>
>6 7 6 9 3 10 8 2 7 8

### 输出例子
>6

## 题目解析
>大概是25分值最简单的题了，一开始看错题意以为是要求E天中超过E的骑行时间的天数···结果写一下发现也有24分····
>
>题目大意：**求满足有E天骑车超过E英里的最大整数E**。将数组从大到小排列，然后计算 **data[i] > i + 1** 的个数即可

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n, e = 0; cin >> n;
	vector<int> data(n);
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		cin >> data[i];
	sort(data.begin(), data.end(),greater<int>());
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		if (data[i] > i + 1)
			e++;
	cout << e;
	return 0;
}
```
