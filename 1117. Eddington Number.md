# 1117 Eddington Number （25 分)

British astronomer Eddington liked to ride a bike. It is said that in order to show off his skill, he has even defined an "Eddington number", EEE \-\- that is, the maximum integer EEE such that it is for EEE days that one rides more than EEE miles. Eddington's own EEE was 87.

Now given everyday's distances that one rides for NNN days, you are supposed to find the corresponding EEE (≤N\\le N≤N).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer NNN (≤105\\le 10^5≤10​5​​), the days of continuous riding. Then NNN non-negative integers are given in the next line, being the riding distances of everyday.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the Eddington number for these NNN days.

### Sample Input:

    10
    6 7 6 9 3 10 8 2 7 8
    

### Sample Output:

    6

### 题目解析

大概是25分值最简单的题了，一开始看错题意以为是要求E天中超过E的骑行时间的天数···结果写一下发现也有24分····

题目大意：**求满足有E天骑车超过E英里的最大整数E**。将数组从大到小排列，然后计算 **data[i] > i + 1** 的个数即可

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n, e = 0; cin >> n;
	vector<int> data(n);
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		cin >> data[i];
	sort(data.begin(), data.end(),greater<int>());
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		if (data[i] > i + 1)
			e++;
	cout << e;
	return 0;
}
```
