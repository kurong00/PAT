# 1018 Public Bike Management (30 分)

There is a public bike service in Hangzhou City which provides great convenience to the tourists from all over the world. One may rent a bike at any station and return it to any other stations in the city.

The Public Bike Management Center (PBMC) keeps monitoring the real-time capacity of all the stations. A station is said to be in **perfect** condition if it is exactly half-full. If a station is full or empty, PBMC will collect or send bikes to adjust the condition of that station to perfect. And more, all the stations on the way will be adjusted as well.

When a problem station is reported, PBMC will always choose the shortest path to reach that station. If there are more than one shortest path, the one that requires the least number of bikes sent from PBMC will be chosen.

The above figure illustrates an example. The stations are represented by vertices and the roads correspond to the edges. The number on an edge is the time taken to reach one end station from another. The number written inside a vertex SSS is the current number of bikes stored at SSS. Given that the maximum capacity of each station is 10. To solve the problem at S3S_3S​3​​, we have 2 different shortest paths:

1.  PBMC -> S1S_1S​1​​ -\> S3S_3S​3​​. In this case, 4 bikes must be sent from PBMC, because we can collect 1 bike from S1S_1S​1​​ and then take 5 bikes to S3S_3S​3​​, so that both stations will be in perfect conditions.
    
2.  PBMC -> S2S_2S​2​​ -\> S3S_3S​3​​. This path requires the same time as path 1, but only 3 bikes sent from PBMC and hence is the one that will be chosen.
    

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 4 numbers: CmaxC_{max}C​max​​ (≤100\\le 100≤100), always an even number, is the maximum capacity of each station; NNN (≤500\\le 500≤500), the total number of stations; SpS_pS​p​​, the index of the problem station (the stations are numbered from 1 to NNN, and PBMC is represented by the vertex 0); and MMM, the number of roads. The second line contains NNN non-negative numbers CiC_iC​i​​ (i=1,⋯,Ni=1,\\cdots ,Ni=1,⋯,N) where each CiC_iC​i​​ is the current number of bikes at SiS_iS​i​​ respectively. Then MMM lines follow, each contains 3 numbers: SiS_iS​i​​, SjS_jS​j​​, and TijT_{ij}T​ij​​ which describe the time TijT_{ij}T​ij​​ taken to move betwen stations SiS_iS​i​​ and SjS_jS​j​​. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in one line. First output the number of bikes that PBMC must send. Then after one space, output the path in the format: 0−>S1−>⋯−>Sp0->S\_1->\\cdots ->S\_p0−>S​1​​−>⋯−>S​p​​. Finally after another space, output the number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC after the condition of SpS_pS​p​​ is adjusted to perfect.

Note that if such a path is not unique, output the one that requires minimum number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC. The judge's data guarantee that such a path is unique.

### Sample Input:

    10 3 3 5
    6 7 0
    0 1 1
    0 2 1
    0 3 3
    1 3 1
    2 3 1
    

### Sample Output:

    3 0->2->3 0

### 题目解析

Dijkstra + DFS。Dijkstra求最短路径，DFS求minNeed和minBack和path，DFS的时候模拟一遍需要调整的过程，求出最后得到的need和back，与minNeed和minBack比较然后根据情况更新path，path是从最后一个结点一直到第一个结点的，所以要输出的时候要倒着输出

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 1e8, N = 501;
int cmax, spt, n, m, minNeed = INF, minBack = INF, city[N][N], bikes[N], visitd[N], dis[N];
vector<int> pre[N], tempPath, path;
void DFS(int v) {
	tempPath.push_back(v);
	if (v == 0) {
		int need = 0, back = 0;
		for (int i = tempPath.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			int id = tempPath[i];
			if (bikes[id] > 0)
				back += bikes[id];
			else {
				if (back > (0 - bikes[id]))
					back += bikes[id];
				else {
					need += ((0 - bikes[id]) - back);
					back = 0;
				}
			}
		}
		if (need < minNeed) {
			minNeed = need;
			minBack = back;
			path = tempPath;
		}

			path = tempPath;

		tempPath.pop_back();

	}
	for (int i = 0; i < pre[v].size(); i++)

		visitd[u] = 1;
		for (int v = 0; v <= n; v++)
			if (!visitd[v] && city[u][v] != INF) {
				if (dis[v] > city[u][v] + dis[u]) {
					dis[v] = city[u][v] + dis[u];
					pre[v].clear();
					pre[v].push_back(u);
				}
				else if (dis[v] == city[u][v] + dis[u])
					pre[v].push_back(u);
